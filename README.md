PayEngine - Secure Payment System Core

PayEngine is an open-source C++ implementation of the core logic for a payment system, designed for financial institutions and developers seeking to build secure, high-performance payment solutions.

Core Features

🔐 Blockchain-Based Secure Ledger

Server-maintained, cryptographically signed transaction blockchain

Centralized architecture optimized for institutional use

Fast, tamper-proof transaction records without the overhead of decentralization

🛡️ Fault Tolerance and Data Recovery

Clients store balances with server signatures

Distributed data recovery from client endpoints in case of server failure

Eliminates single points of failure common in traditional payment systems

🎭 Privacy-Preserving Transactions

Tokenization technology replaces sensitive data during transmission

Anti-tracking mechanisms enhance user privacy

Ensures data security throughout the payment processing flow

🛡️ Built-in Security Layers

Custom HTTP/HTTPS request filtering firewall

Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and common network attacks

Security-first architecture built from the ground up

Technical Scope

Pure C++ implementation focused on core payment logic

Modular design for easy integration and extensibility

Intended for educational/research purposes—not rigorously security-audited and unsuitable for production environments
